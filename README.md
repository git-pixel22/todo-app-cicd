<h1>Project Description</h1>

This project involves setting up a CI/CD pipeline for a Node.js todo application. The pipeline is implemented using Jenkins, Docker, and AWS EC2. The goal of this project is to automate the deployment process and enable continuous integration and continuous delivery.

The steps involved in setting up the pipeline include:

Setting up an AWS EC2 instance with Java and Jenkins installed
Configuring security groups for the instance to allow access from other users
Connecting the GitHub repository for the Node.js app to Jenkins using SSH tokens
Containerizing the Node.js app using Docker and writing a Dockerfile
Building the Node.js app in Jenkins and reflecting the changes in the code base
Implementing webhooks to trigger the build process automatically whenever there is a change in the code base

With the CI/CD pipeline in place, the deployment process for the Node.js todo app becomes automated, saving time and reducing the risk of errors.
